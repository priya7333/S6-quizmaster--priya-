# QuizMaster

A lightweight quiz application for creating, running, and reviewing quizzes.

**Features:**
- Create and organize quizzes using the `data/` directory

## Requirements

Install required Python packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

```
python Home.py
```

Adjust the command if you use a virtual environment or different Python executable.

## Project Layout

- `Home.py` — main entry point
- `data/` — quiz data and assets
- `pages/` — UI pages or views
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies

## Development

- Edit or add quizzes inside `data/`.
- Modify or add pages under `pages/` for new views.
- Run `Home.py` to preview changes.
